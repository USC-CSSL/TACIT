        The French are not the only ones to think subway system-inspired designs are chic (''Transit Chic,'' editorial Topics, Dec. 22). London Transport also sells T-shirts, greeting cards, jigsaw puzzles, teapot stands, dishes and a wide range of other items bearing representations of the system map, buses and station names. Both licensing programs have substantial financial benefit for their respective agencies: Paris's Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens earned $1.5 million in royalty payments in 1985; London Transport earns more than $2 million a year.
        Several North American transportation agencies, including those in Boston, Montreal, San Francisco and Toronto are looking into licensing their logos and other symbols. In its recent report on marketing at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A recommended that New York's transportation agency do the same.
        Licensing, we believe, could not only raise a few million dollars for the M.T.A., by making New York's transit systems seem as chic as Paris's with its little yellow ticket, but a licensing campaign might also convince a few more metropolitan-area residents and workers to get out of autos, taxis and express buses, and back onto subways, buses and trains.
        New York needs its transportation system to support its economy - and the transit system needs its riders. In this period of rebuilding and refurbishing at the M.T.A., we feel licensing would be a good step toward marketing its newly clean and efficient services.
