        JUDITH STILES' new shop offers 50 different tile designs by the owner, a former adjunct professor of ceramics at Pratt Institute, designs of 20 other American ceramicists - and a host of services. ''We will custom-color and design tiles in solid colors or floral or geometric patterns,'' said Ms. Stiles, right, about the Manhattan store that bears her name. ''We can make relief tiles, duplicate antique tiles, match a wallpaper pattern, or take a photo of your family or dog, and render the picture realistically on a tile.'' There are tiles featuring hares, black bears, fish and raccoons, as well as a tile with a raised surface in the shape of a purple iris. Ceramicists will copy traditional Delft tiles or others to match any pottery the customer likes.
        In the peach-colored store, the counter functions as a work area where the customers and Ms. Stiles can rearrange tiles and experiment with different colors and patterns. For her customers, Ms. Stiles or one of her ceramicists, will make up free sample tiles, which customers can take home.
        A tile costs $3 or more, and is sold be the tile, not by the square foot. Examples shown include Susan Parks's tiles of stippled flowers, above left, ($15); John O'Hara's cartoons, above right, ($14), or Ms. Stiles' squiggle or geometric-patterned tile, above center ($3). To mix with the custom tiles, Ms. Stiles sells inexpensive solid-colored American Olean tiles in 40 colors, which cost 30 to 80 cents apiece, depending on the size. She also provides customers with a 21-page ''Do-It-Yourself Installation Kit.'' The store is at 392 Bleecker Street near Perry Street.
