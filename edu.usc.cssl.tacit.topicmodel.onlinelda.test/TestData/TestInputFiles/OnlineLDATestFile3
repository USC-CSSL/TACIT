        LEAD: A WAY to lower noise levels in the home is to install acoustical materials such as ceiling tiles and wall panels. These materials absorb sound created within a room to lower the noise level in that room and in adjacent rooms. But they help only slightly to keep out noise from an adjoining room or apartment.
        A WAY to lower noise levels in the home is to install acoustical materials such as ceiling tiles and wall panels. These materials absorb sound created within a room to lower the noise level in that room and in adjacent rooms. But they help only slightly to keep out noise from an adjoining room or apartment.
        If you live in an apartment and your neighbor is noisy, installing acoustical tile on your side of the wall is useless unless your neighbor puts acoustical material on his or her side. The same is true for noises from the room above. Acoustical tile on the ceiling will not decrease noise transmission, but covering the upstairs floor with carpeting and foam padding should be effective.
        To lower noise that comes through the wall, you can seal wall openings through which sound waves can travel or you can install sound-insulating materials or make alterations to walls or ceilings to isolate or block the vibrations that cause noise to travel from one room to another.
        Since sound waves normally travel through the air, a logical first step would be to close and seal openings through which air can enter. This would be achieved by caulking holes and openings around pipes or electrical wiring and installing weatherstripping around doors and windows.
        Insulation can sometimes help, but only if enough of it is used and if it can be installed inside wall, ceiling or floor cavities. Sound-deadening board will usually help slightly if installed on the surface of a wall or ceiling, but it serves as more of a sound absorber than as sound insulation.
        The most effective method is to structurally isolate the noise. Noise generated on one side of a wall causes vibrations on the other side. This occurs even when there is no opening through which airwaves can pass because noise creates vibrations that come through the other side. The best way to prevent this is to build two separate walls or partitions that are not in direct contact with each other (see drawing). This will prevent vibrations on one side from being transmitted to the other side. Filling the hollow spaces with bulky insulation will create an even more effective sound barrier.
        Since putting up a second wall or partition means losing from four to six inches of floor space inside the room, you might prefer to build a single wall with staggered studs. As illustrated in the drawing, this involves using a 2-by-6 instead of a 2-by-4 as the bottom plate, then offsetting every other stud by two inches. The result is a thicker wall with gypsum-board panels on one side nailed to a different set of studs than are the gypsum-board panels on the other side. Sound waves that cause one side to vibrate cannot affect panels on the other side. Weaving thick batts of fiberglass insulation back and forth between the studs will further help.
        Both techniques are mainly used in new construction or when extensive alterations involve removing or rebuilding interior walls. In existing construction,two other techniques are often used to convert an existing wall into a more-soundproof one.
        The simplest method involves installing a second layer of gypsum board over the existing surface. Best results are achieved if the first layer is a sound-deadening board and the second is gypsum board. The effect will be even more pronounced if this is done on both sides of the wall. In each case, the extra layer of wallboard will add bulk and mass to that wall, greatly improving the acoustical insulating abilities of any wall.
        A more effective way to soundproof an existing wall is to remove the gypsum board from one or both sides, then re-install it on top of resilient metal channels, as shown in the drawing. The channels are attached to the studs with screws along one edge, with the other edge left free. Drywall panels are then attached to these channels with drywall screws instead of nailing them directly to the studs. This creates a ''floating'' wall surface that will absorb vibrations without transmitting them to studs or panels on the other side.
        Insulating a ceiling against the transmission of noise from the room above is usually more of a problem than insulating walls. One reason is that the most common type of noise - someone walking (or stamping) across the floor - creates impact noise, which travels through joists, beams and other structural members. The only practical insulation against such noise is rebuilding the floor above so there is a layer of sound-deadening board under the finished flooring. Carpeting with a thick pad underneath would also help greatly.
        When there is enough headroom, noises from upstairs can also be curbed by installing a suspended ceiling that consists of an aluminum grid hung on wires below the existing ceiling. This grid supports panels of acoustical material that form the finished ceiling. The space above this can be filled with thick batts of fiberglass insulation.
        In rooms with insufficient headroom for a suspended ceiling, screw long lengths of resilient acoustical channel of the kind described for use on walls. The ceiling is then covered with another layer of gypsum board or sound-deadening board by attaching the panels to these channels with screws. By fastening this second layer of gypsum board to the channels instead of to the joists in the ceiling, you create a ''floating'' ceiling that isolates vibrations and helps eliminate the transmission of noise.
        For maximum effect, close all openings. Even the smallest hole or crack will allow sound waves to pass. Adding bulk insulation to the inside of a wall helps only if the wall (or ceiling) is built using staggered studs or with resilient channels. Adding insulation to the cavities of conventional stud walls normally will not help much.
        None of these techniques will help much to keep out noise that originates outside the house (unless you are ready to rebuild the exterior walls). The only ways of dealing with these noises is to install draperies or shutters over the windows, weatherstrip all doors and windows, add storm sash to all windows that face the direction of the noise and plant tall shrubs or bushes as a barrier between you and the source of the noise. Even a tall fence will help, but only if it is fairly solid with few openings.
