The Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may suspend payments to any such fiduciary who shall neglect or refuse, after reasonable notice, to render an account to the Secretary from time to time showing the application of such payments for the benefit of such incompetent or minor beneficiary, or who shall neglect or refuse to administer the estate according to law. The Secretary may require the fiduciary, as part of such account, to disclose any additional financial information concerning the beneficiary (except for information that is not available to the fiduciary). The Secretary may appear or intervene by the Secretary's duly authorized attorney in any court as an interested party in any litigation instituted by the Secretary or otherwise, directly affecting money paid to such fiduciary under this section.     ``(c) Payment of Certain Expenses.--Authority is hereby granted for the payment of any court or other expenses incident to any investigation or court proceeding for the appointment of any fiduciary or other person for the purpose of payment of benefits payable under laws administered by the Secretary or the removal of such fiduciary and appointment of another, and of expenses in connection with the administration of such benefits by such fiduciaries, or in connection with any other court proceeding hereby authorized, when such payment is authorized by the Secretary.     ``(d) Temporary Payment of Benefits.--All or any part of any benefits the payment of which is suspended or withheld under this section may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be paid temporarily to the person [Page: H620] having custody and control of the incompetent or minor beneficiary, to be used solely for the benefit of such beneficiary, or, in the case of an incompetent veteran, may be apportioned to the dependent or dependents, if any, of such veteran. Any part not so paid and any funds of a mentally incompetent or insane veteran not paid to the chief officer of the institution in which such veteran is a patient nor apportioned to the veteran's dependent or dependents may be ordered held in the Treasury to the credit of such beneficiary. All funds so held shall be disbursed under the order and in the discretion of the Secretary for the benefit of such beneficiary or the beneficiary's dependents.

In the event of the death of a mentally incompetent or insane veteran, all gratuitous benefits under laws administered by the Secretary deposited before or after August 7, 1959, in the personal funds of patient's trust fund on account of such veteran shall not be paid to the personal representative of such veteran, but shall be paid to the following persons living at the time of settlement, and in the order named: The surviving spouse, the children (without regard to age or marital status) in equal parts, and the dependent parents of such veteran, in equal parts. If any balance remains, such balance shall be deposited to the credit of the applicable current appropriation; except that there may be paid only so much of such balance as may be necessary to reimburse a person (other than a political subdivision of the United States) who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial of the veteran for such expenses. No payment shall be made under the two preceding sentences of this subsection unless claim therefor is filed with the Secretary within five years after the death of the veteran, except that, if any person so entitled under said two sentences is under legal disability at the time of death of the veteran, such five-year period of limitation shall run from the termination or removal of the legal disability.     ``(e) Escheatment.--Any funds in the hands of a fiduciary appointed by a State court or the Secretary derived from benefits payable under laws administered by the Secretary, which under the law of the State wherein the beneficiary had last legal residence would escheat to the State, shall escheat to the United States and shall be returned by such fiduciary, or by the personal representative of the deceased beneficiary, less legal expenses of any administration necessary to determine that an escheat is in order, to the Department, and shall be deposited to the credit of the applicable revolving fund, trust fund, or appropriation.     ``(f) Assistance.--The Secretary shall provide to a fiduciary appointed under section 5502 of this title materials and tools to assist the fiduciary in carrying out the responsibilities of the fiduciary under this chapter, including--     ``(1) handbooks, brochures, or other written material that explain the responsibilities of a fiduciary under this chapter;     ``(2) tools located on an Internet website, including forms to submit to the Secretary required information; and     ``(3) assistance provided by telephone.''.     (2) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.--The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 55 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 5502 the following new item:    ``5502A.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE.     (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:     (1) There are at least 3,600,000 veterans currently living with service-connected disabilities.     (2) As a result of their service, many veterans are permanently disabled throughout their lives and in many cases must rely on the support of their families and friends when these visible and invisible burdens become too much to bear alone.     (3) October 5, which is the anniversary of the dedication of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, has been recognized as an appropriate day on which to honor American veterans disabled for life each year.     (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--     (1) expresses its appreciation to the men and women left permanently wounded, ill, or injured as a result of their service in the Armed Forces;     (2) supports the annual recognition of American veterans disabled for life each year; and     (3) encourages the American people to honor American veterans disabled for life each year with appropriate programs and activities.    SEC. 18. EXTENSION OF PILOT PROGRAM ON COUNSELING IN RETREAT SETTINGS FOR WOMEN VETERANS NEWLY SEPARATED FROM SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES.     Section 203(d) of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-163; 38 U.S.C. 1712A note) is amended by striking ``December 31, 2016'' and inserting ``December 31, 2021''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes.    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.    GENERAL LEAVE    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and add extraneous materials to H.R. 677, as amended.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana?    There was no objection.    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 677, as amended.    H.R. 677, as amended, contains many important provisions that would help [Page: H626] our Nation's veterans, including provisions to provide an automatic annual COLA, cost-of-living adjustment, for veterans' benefits; expedite the processing of veterans' claims and appeals; improve VA's fiduciary program; expand the official documentation accepted by the Secretary of Defense to grant veteran status with limited benefits to World War II Merchant Marine and Coastwise Merchant Seamen; designate certain cities as American World War II cities; and express the sense of Congress honoring American veterans disabled for life.    I want to recognize the hard work of the Members whose proposals have been incorporated into H.R. 677, as amended. I particularly want to thank my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee: Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Brown, Ms. Titus, Dr. Ruiz, Mr. Walz, and Mr. O'Rourke. In addition, I want to acknowledge the contributions of Representatives Johnson, Butterfield, Latta, Rouzer, and Frankel.    H.R. 677, as amended, incorporates legislation that Chairman Miller introduced that would expand the eligibility for a medallion provided by VA for private headstones that identify the deceased as a veteran.    These medallions may be attached to privately purchased headstones of veterans who are buried in private cemeteries. They are inscribed with the word ``veteran'' across the top, and the branch of service is inscribed along the bottom. The medallions have proven to be very popular, with many families choosing to use it to honor the service of their loved one.    Unfortunately, current law only authorizes medallions for veterans who died before November 1, 1990. During a Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee hearing, the VA testified that it has been forced to deny 91 percent of applications for medallions because the requests were made by families of veterans who died before November 1, 1990.    H.R. 677, as amended, would allow the VA to provide these medallions to individuals who served in the Armed Forces after April 6, 1917, which is the date the United States entered World War I.    The reason that this proposal limits eligibility to those who served after April 6, 1917, is due to the possibility that attaching a medallion to an older headstone may cause damage. There are also concerns that placing medallions on antique headstones in older cemeteries may alter the appearance of historic cemeteries.    H.R. 677, as amended, would protect historic gravestones and cemeteries, but also recognizes the importance in honoring the service and sacrifice of those who have served our Nation in the Armed Forces.    These medallions ensure that veterans who are buried in private cemeteries and whose graves are marked by privately purchased headstones can easily be distinguished. I hope that when people visit these cemeteries and see these medallions they take a few moments to remember that we all owe our freedom to our Nation's veterans. These patriotic heroes deserve nothing less.    This bill also includes the text of H.R. 1575, a bill that was introduced by Ranking Member Brown to extend a pilot program on counseling in retreat settings for women veterans who are newly separated from service. This pilot was originally authorized in 2010, and pilot participants have reported unanimously positive experiences and a significant improvement in well-being, stress, and positive coping skills following their participation in the retreats.    I am grateful to the ranking member for sponsoring this provision in recognition of the good work being done in this pilot program and the need to ensure that women veterans continue to have access to it.    There are many provisions in H.R. 677, as amended, that would help improve services for veterans and their families, but I want to focus my remarks on the section that I am proud to have authored.    First, the bill would authorize an automatic annual COLA for beneficiaries who receive VA disability compensation. Although Congress generally approves COLA legislation every year, veterans have to wait until Congress actually acts. This can be very stressful for our veterans and their families who depend on their payments to make ends meet. Our Nation's heroes should not have to wait to know whether they are going to be able to pay their bills or not.    H.R. 677, as amended, would ensure that our Nation's veterans automatically receive the same annual COLA as Social Security recipients. This critical provision will help our Nation's veterans better plan for their financial future, and I urge all Members to support it.    Second, this legislation would help make it more convenient for veterans to schedule disability examinations by extending the temporary authorization that allows the VA to use contract physicians to conduct disability examinations through 2017.    Veterans in rural areas, like the Fifth District which I represent, may have to travel long distances to see a VA examiner for a disability examination. My proposal would make it easier to schedule disability examinations by permitting the VA to contract with any physician with a current, unrestricted license to conduct    these examinations in the United States.    Additionally, H.R. 677, as amended, would require the VA to provide Congress with regular types of claims veterans file. This information will help better inform our efforts to reform the VA and ensure veterans receive timely, accurate claims decisions.    Section 4 of H.R. 677, as amended, would also express the sense of Congress that the VA should develop a designated form for an increased rating claim or reopening of a claim that does not require the resubmittal of information previously submitted to the Department.    I am grateful for the ranking member's response in this provision in recognition of the good work being done in this pilot program, and we need to ensure that it is passed. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    I would like to express my appreciation to all the members of our committee who have worked to address these issues in a bipartisan manner, and I truly hope we can stay focused on what is important here, which is helping veterans.    This bill extends a pilot counseling program for women veterans separating from the military and coping with PTSD and other combat-related stress issues. These specialized programs are helping women transition from the military and start the next phase of their lives.    I would also like to highlight an important piece of this legislation that was originally introduced by my friend and colleague, Mr. O'Rourke, the Express Appeals Act.    As highlighted by my friend and colleague, Representative Titus, other members of the committee, and even the VA Secretary just 2 weeks ago, the appeals process is in crisis. We in the House have heard the cry for help and have responded.    After passing this bill, we will wait for our friends in the Senate to take action. We encourage them to remember our veterans suffer for our inaction. This action provides a critical and widely supported alternative appeals process.    I applaud Representatives O'ROURKE and COOK, Chairman Miller, the VA, the Board of Appeals, the DAV, the VFW, PVA, AMVETS, IAVA, and MOAA in working together for almost 2 years to reach broad consensus on an alternative path forward.    The Express Appeals Act, similar to the VA's Fully Developed Claim program, offers veterans an alternative option to do more of the work on their own, with the promise of an expedited decision from the Board of Veterans Appeals.    My friend and colleague, Representative Ruiz's bill, H.R. 2691, the Veterans' Survivors Claims Processing and Automation Act of 2015, is also included in this legislation. This provision would automate claims for the surviving family members of veterans.    I truly believe how we treat our veterans plays a major role in who is willing to fight our wars and defend our Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello). [Page: H627]        Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 677, the American Heroes COLA Act.    There are a lot of very excellent provisions to this bill, not the least of which is the automatic COLA, but I actually want to speak to part of this bill that deals with the claims processing.    The legislation offered by my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) would set out to improve the claims processing through several steps. I want to highlight them.    First, it would require the VA to accept medical evidence from medical professionals in the community to support veterans' disability claims. Second, it would establish a commission to independently evaluate the VA's disability claims and appealed claims backlog. Last, it would develop an alternative program to determine appeals for disability claims more quickly.    Each of these steps offers solutions to the current backlog. This bill is a smart, proactive, bipartisan bill that will help reduce the daunting piles of paperwork and delays that many veterans continue to face.    I am very proud to be in support of this bill. It is another step in doing our best to reduce the claims backlog, and I thank Mr. Abraham for his leadership on this.    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 677, as amended.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Let me first thank Mr. Takano for yielding, and I thank all of you for your advocacy on this bill. This is a very, very important piece of legislation for our veterans.    Mr. Speaker, we are running out of time to finally recognize the critical contributions of a forgotten but critical segment of brave men and women who served our country during World War II. Because we are running out of time, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 677, which contains provisions from my bill, H.R. 1288, that would create a pathway for these forgotten individuals to finally be recognized for their service to our country.    I am referring to an overlooked segment of the World War II Merchant Marine, known as Coastwise Merchant Seamen. These men and women, Mr. Speaker, served the vital role of transporting raw materials and supplies between our domestic military installations and production facilities during the war. Their jobs were absolutely essential to the war effort.    To this day, many of these mariners have never been recognized for their service, largely at no fault of their own, but rather because of decisions made by the Federal Government. It has been virtually impossible for many of these mariners to obtain the required documents needed to prove their World War II service due to government orders that either had these documents destroyed or never kept at all.    Even today, government inaction and delay on transferring the surviving documents to the National Archives and Records Administration makes searching for and obtaining the required documents practically impossible. As each day passes, this issue grows more acute due to the advanced age of these mariners.    We must make it possible for these great Americans to receive their due recognition while we still have the chance.     [Time: 16:15]    More importantly, we have to do this now, while these mariners still have the chance to know that their sacrifices were not in vain, and their Nation and government are appreciative of their service.    Mr. Speaker, these mariners are national treasures, and we are here today because of their sacrifices. They deserve, each of them, to be recognized for their service, and I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort by voting ``yes'' on this bill.    I want to thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Brown, subcommittee Chairman Abraham, and Ranking Member Titus for working with me and my staff on this issue, and including provisions of my bill in the base text.    I want to thank the committee staff for all of their hard work. I am appreciative of their efforts. This has been a true team effort, and we are now one step closer to finally doing the right thing.    Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank Mr. Takano for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 677, a bill that honors American veterans disabled for life. I thank my friend from Florida, Chairman Jeff Miller, for cosponsoring this bill with me and shepherding its passage.    As the mother of a United States Marine veteran, I want to first start by thanking all our veterans who have served us. Thankfully for my family, my son returned safely from two wars.    But, sadly, there are many for whom leaving the battlefield does not mark the end of a conflict, for them or their family. Jeff Colaiacovo is one of those people. I am proud to say he is a constituent and one of my heroes.    On his 18th birthday, unlike many young men of his generation, he volunteered for the Army to go to the Vietnam War, and it would be brutal.    A few months into his tour, in 1967, Jeff's tank hit a mine, and shrapnel exploded into his eyes, blinding him. Miraculously, the doctors were able to recover his vision, and soon after, he was back on the battlefield.    Then, on August 30, 1967, Jeff's tank was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, trapping him inside, his body engulfed in flames. He spent 5 months in burn units around the world.    He left the Army with an honorable discharge. And, again, he was not to be deterred. He got married. He raised children. He started a small business.    The thing is, Mr. Speaker, the injuries he sustained during his service left him disabled for life. And to this day, Jeff is under heavy medication for PTSD. He bears the scars of duty that remind us all of what he and many others gave in serving us.    Now, this bill recognizes that October 5 is the anniversary of the dedication of the Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, a magnificent memorial that sits just steps away from the Capitol.    On one of its walls reads a quote from Dwight D. Eisenhower: ``Each of you bears upon his body the permanent, honorable scars of dangerous service: service rendered in order that our great nation might continue to live according to the expressed will of its own citizens.''    In honor of Jeff, and so many others, let's pass this bill.    Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    As I conclude, I would like to speak about a provision in this bill. Included here is language extending the very successful pilot program run by the Department of Veterans Affairs which provides psychiatric and psychological counseling and support in retreat settings for newly returned women veterans.    A Veterans Health Administration report showed that this limited, 2-year pilot program, run by the Readjustment Counseling Service, produced positive, measurable results helping returning women veterans experiencing post-traumatic stress, depression, sleep disturbances and isolation, many having been evaluated as service-connected for severe PTSD.    In surveys, participants have consistently reported experiencing a marked decrease in stress symptoms and an increase in coping skills, including understanding better how to develop support systems and to access available resources at the VA and in their communities as they reenter civilian life.    Post-9/11 women veterans, often combat veterans, are brought together in groups of about 20, in outdoor settings. These veterans, most of whom are coping with the effects of severe PTSD, some as a result of sexual trauma while in the military, participated in trust-building exercises and worked with counselors and psychological educators to build peer support.    Financial and occupational counseling and conflict resolution training were also offered on an as-needed basis.    I urge support of this provision and the underlying legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I continue to urge support of H.R. 677.    I yield back the balance of my time. [Begin Insert] [Page: H628]        Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 677, the ``American Heroes COLA Act.''    This bill requires that, whenever there is an increase in benefit amounts payable under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase by the same percentage the amounts payable as veterans' disability compensation.    H.R. 677 does the following:    1. compensates for dependents    2. a clothing allowance for certain disabled adults    3. compensation for surviving spouses and children    This bill requires that veterans are given the correct percentage and benefit amounts from the Social Security Act.    Retired military veterans, VA rates for compensation and pension for disabled veterans and surviving families will be effective December 1, 2015 and will be reflected on the first check to be paid on December 31, 2015.    Congress enacted the COLA provision as part of the 1972 Social Security Amendments, and automatic annual COLAs began in 1975. Before that, benefits were increased only when Congress enacted special legislation.    COLA impacts benefits to about 59 social security recipients, 1.96 million military retirees and 4 million disabled veterans.    This increase in benefit amounts will help alleviate financial stress that millions of our disabled veterans have.    As the sponsor of H.R. 76 ``the HERO Transition from Battlespace to Workplace Act,'' I strongly support our veterans and any bill that helps mitigate soldier to citizen transition.    As Abraham Lincoln stated, ``Honor to the soldier and sailor everywhere, who bravely bears his country's cause. Honor, also, to the citizen who cares for his brother in the field and serves, as he best can, the same cause.''    H.R. 677 is a positive step forward in increasing in benefit amounts payable as veteran's disability compensation.    I strongly support this bill and urge my colleagues to join me and do the same. [End Insert]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 677, as amended.    The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.    The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for annual cost-of-living adjustments to be made automatically by law each year in the rates of disability compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for survivors of certain service-connected disabled veterans, and for other purposes.''.    A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
